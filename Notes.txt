Git Stage: 
Commits are safe from deletions
Untracked files == Unstaged == Dirty

Add  - command adds untracked files to the stage. "Changes are staged" but not commited. 


Commit - Commits files to to committed. 

modify - Takes files from committed to unstaged/untracked

A repo is clean when a stage is completely committed.
